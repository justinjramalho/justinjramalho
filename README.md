#### My First Principles  

###### What Iâ€™ve learned from my life experiences inâ€¦ 

- **Relationships.**  You miss ðŸ’¯ of the shots you donâ€™t take.  
- **Law.**  Life is not fair.  If you donâ€™t ask, you canâ€™t get.  
- **Healthcare.**  Individualism of care saves lives.  
- **Research.**  If it doesnâ€™t consider environment, itâ€™s unreliable.  
- **Education.**  Providing choice(s) increases engagement.  
- **Design.**  Good design is a lot harder to notice than poor design.  
- **Security.**  99% of attacks are executed using known exploits.  
- **Engineering.**  Always start with first principles.
