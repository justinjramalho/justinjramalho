- 👋 Hi, I’m Justin J. Ramalho (@justinjramalho) 
- 👀 I’m interested in web3 software development and blockchain compliance.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development (HTML 5, CSS3, JS), data science methodologies (Python 3), and cybersecurity compliance principles (OWASP Top 10).  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational technologies that reverse-engineer degree mapping and career-related academic structures to enhance pathway to career pipeline; I am focused on streamlining the 'business of education' and students' path to career, while automating soft-skills to create a community of entrepreneur-minded, independent young adults.
