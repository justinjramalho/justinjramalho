- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web3 software development and blockchain compliance.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development (HTML 5, CSS3, JS), data science methodologies (Python 3), and cybersecurity compliance principles (OWASP Top 10).  
- ðŸ’ž Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on educational technologies that reverse-engineer degree mapping and career-related academic structures to enhance pathway to career pipeline; I am focused on streamlining the 'business of education' and students' path to career, while automating soft-skills to create a community of entrepreneur-minded, independent young adults.

#### My First Principles

###### What Iâ€™ve learned from my life experiences inâ€¦ 

- **Relationships.**  You miss ðŸ’¯ of the shots you donâ€™t take.  
- **Law.**  Life is not fair.  If you donâ€™t ask, you wonâ€™t get.  
- **Healthcare.**  Individualism of care saves lives.  
- **Research.**  If it doesnâ€™t consider environment, itâ€™s unreliable.  
- **Education.**  Choice increases engagement.  
- **Design.**  Good design is a lot harder to notice than poor design.  
- **Security.**  99% of attacks are done using known exploits.  
- **Engineering.**  Always start with first principles.
